//! Parser for yarn.lock, covering both classic (v1) and berry (v2+).
//!
//! ## Classic (v1)
//!
//! Line-based, similar to YAML but not quite:
//!
//! ```text
//! # comment
//! "@scope/pkg@^1.0.0", "@scope/pkg@^1.1.0":
//!   version "1.2.3"
//!   resolved "https://..."
//!   integrity sha512-...
//!   dependencies:
//!     other-pkg "^2.0.0"
//! ```
//!
//! Top-level blocks are keyed by one or more comma-separated specifiers
//! (`name@range`). The body is indented 2 spaces. Nested sections like
//! `dependencies:` add another 2 spaces of indentation.
//!
//! ## Berry (v2+)
//!
//! Proper YAML with a `__metadata:` header and per-block
//! `resolution:` / `checksum:` / `languageName` / `linkType` fields:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! __metadata:
//!   version: 8
//!   cacheKey: 10c0
//!
//! "@scope/pkg@npm:^1.0.0, @scope/pkg@npm:^1.1.0":
//!   version: 1.1.0
//!   resolution: "@scope/pkg@npm:1.1.0"
//!   dependencies:
//!     foo: "npm:^2.0.0"
//!   checksum: 10c0/aabbcc...
//!   languageName: node
//!   linkType: hard
//! ```
//!
//! Multi-spec headers are serialized as a single YAML string containing
//! `", "`-separated specifiers. Values carry a protocol prefix: `npm:`
//! for registry packages (the common case), `workspace:` for monorepo
//! refs, `file:` / `link:` / `portal:` for local paths, `patch:` for
//! patched packages, and full URLs for `git:` / `http(s):` sources.
//!
//! yarn.lock does not distinguish direct deps from transitive ones, so we
//! cross-reference specifiers against the project's package.json to populate
//! `importers["."]`.
